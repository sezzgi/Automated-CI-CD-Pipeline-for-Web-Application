# Jenkins Pipeline for Web App Deployment

## Overview

This project showcases a production-grade DevOps pipeline that automatically deploys a containerized todo web application across multiple AWS EC2 instances. The application enables users to create and manage their todo items through an intuitive web interface, with data persistently stored in PostgreSQL.

## Technical Highlights

- **Modern Architecture**: Built with React (frontend), Node.js (backend), and PostgreSQL (database), each running in isolated Docker containers
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Fully automated AWS infrastructure provisioning using Terraform
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins pipeline that handles everything from building Docker images to deployment
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible playbooks manage application configuration and container deployments
- **Container Registry**: Leverages AWS ECR for secure Docker image management

## Value Proposition

This project demonstrates expertise in DevOps practices, containerization, and cloud infrastructure, showing ability to:
- Build scalable, maintainable deployment pipelines
- Implement security best practices with proper isolation and access controls
- Automate complex multi-service deployments
- Manage cloud infrastructure efficiently using modern IaC tools

The end result is a production-ready todo application that showcases both full-stack development and DevOps engineering capabilities.
